  In the current age of obesity, it is important to put things in perspective and focus on strategies that address the root causes. One such cause is the lack of access to healthy grains and the prevalence of processed foods. Architects and designers can play a role in promoting conservation and making healthy food options more stylish and appealing, thereby shining a spotlight on the importance of healthy eating habits.

  However, this requires a revolution in our opinion and understanding of what constitutes a healthy society. It is not enough to simply address the symptoms of obesity; we need to tackle the underlying social and economic factors that contribute to it. By spurring a shift in mindset and strategic action, we can create a healthier and more equitable world for all.
